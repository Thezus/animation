										<br>Having fun yet competetive, is the core of most sports and all Kuroko wanted for his elementry school friends was for them to enjoy the sport they once loved/enjoyed before their increase in performance which happened to be of no match against in the whole of Japan, earning the title <a href="Media/Images/Kuroko/m1.png" ><strong><em>The Generation of Miracles</em></strong></a>.
										<br>This made them the strongest Japan had to offer with an undefeated record, winning matches by doubling or trippling the opponents scores even greater than that if they felt like it. This then becomes boring to the team being unrivaled they only played for the sake of their school and not enjoying nor sharing the love of Ballin'.

									<h3>üèó Marvel Comic Universe</h3>
									<h4><em>üèó Science & Technology : Bio-tech/Nano-tech/Mech-engineering. </em></h4>
									<p>These Marvel storylines can be combined by going through the Marvel Universe storyline as a whole since the topics are spread across more then one storyline (Character/Group/Team).
										ranking from <a href="Medai/Vids/Marvel Science/suba.webm" ><strong><em>Subatomic Particles</em></strong></a> aka <a href="Media/Vids/Marvel Science/Dr Henry Pym/pym.mp4"><strong>Pym Particle</strong></a> (which is mostly referred to by <strong>Dr S Cooper</strong> of <strong>The Big Bang Theory</strong> as part of the character's need to take on another study field of science mostly the <strong>Quantom Theory</strong>) to <strong>Iron Man's</strong> use of <a href="Media/Vids/Marvel Science/iron man suits.webm"><strong><em>Technology (from Mechanical to Nano-Tech)</em></strong></a>, along with <a href=""> <strong>Black Panther's</strong> use of rare elements (<a href=""><strong>Vibranium</strong></a>) to apply his technology in order to obtain maximum performance.

											<br>what they both have in common is their use of technology in order to sustain power (electricity) instead of using harmful chemicals to the O-zone layer (Black Panther's <a href=""><strong>Vibrainium</strong></a>) and the use of rare elements Black Panther share a use of as a weapon is shared by with X-men's Wolverine with his <a href=""><strong><em>Adamantium</em></strong></a> (<a href=""><strong>Vibranium & Adamantium</strong></a>)
											<br>The person part of the <a href=""><strong>Hulk</strong></a> is composed of idea behind how you can't control situtation no matter how hard you try but then having to live with the consiquencies for the rest of your life something he share with another phD holder <a href=""><strong>Dr Strange</strong></a> which other characters mostly mistake this for his <a href=""><strong>"made-up"</strong></a> even though it's his real name within the Marvel Universe. (Hulk's existance is based expiraments gone wrong and in his case within the world <strong>Chemistry</strong>, while expiramenting with the element <a href=""><strong>Gamma</strong></a>) and my favourate thing about Marvel is that it's not only the Hero's who are phD smart with villans such as <a href=""><strong>Atomic Skull</strong></a> and others.
											<br>Not saying everything may be 100% correct nor am I challenging the idea but no matter how the story is told to keep us interested the fact is that Marvel keeps us in the loop when it comes to the most current inventions/career-skills/expiraments and many more...
